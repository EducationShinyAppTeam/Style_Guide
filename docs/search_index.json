This provides us with the ability to present statistical concepts in ways that allow students to explore and build their understandings in dynamic ways. A growing tool on this front are “Shiny Apps”–applications that may be run locally or on the web which are built using the the R language and the shiny package. We are not the first group to build online applications to help students learn ideas, nor will we be the last. In fact, we’re not even the first group to build Shiny apps for Statistics Education. Thus, there are many different approaches to how people go about designing and coding Shiny apps. The primary goal of this document is to lay out the approach that we use to 1) formalize the approach for ourselves, and 2) share our approach with others who are wanting to build their own Shiny apps for teaching. This guide spells out the recommended approach for building and the required styling to be used for all apps included in the Book of Apps for Statistics Teaching (BOAST). You will need to follow this Style Guide to ensure that any app you create meets (or exceeds) our standards and is worthy of inclusion in BOAST. Effective Date: May 17, 2021 All apps created and/or modified after the Effective Date are required to adhere to this version of the Style Guide. Apps which have not been modified since before the Effective Date will be brought into compliance on rolling basis. 0.1 Organization We’ve laid out this document into several parts, each with their own chapters. Part 1: Getting Started Chapter 1—Using a Workflow Chapter 2—Explain Your Idea Part 2: Getting Ready to Code Chapter 3—Setting Up Your Computer Chapter 4—Exploring the Boast Template Part 3: Style Guide–Coding Chapter 5—General BOAST Coding Style Chapter 6—Shiny (BOAST) Specific Coding Practices Chapter 7—HTML and CSS Chapter 8—Additional Coding Information Part 4: Style Guide–App Layout Chapter 9—General Layout Chapter 10—Common/Reoccurring Elements Part 5: Style Guide–Visual Style Chapter 11—Color Chapter 12—Static Images Chapter 13—R Plots Part 6: Style Guide–Language Chapter 14–Wording Chapter 15–Documentation Part 7: Accessibility and Mobile Devices Chapter 16–Accessibility Chapter 17–Mobile Friendliness Yes, this looks long but keep in mind the following: Building an app is easy, but building an app that someone else can use effectively is a challenge. Building apps which support procedural conceptions is quick and easy to do. Building equitable apps which support users in developing productive meanings is much more difficult. Our mission with BOAST is to achieve both with our entire collection. Thus, writing down all of the ins and outs of our process will take a significant amount of space.Whenever possible, we’ve attempted to provide you with examples where you can see our standards in action as well as code that you can use as templates. For each code block, you should be able to place your cursor over the block and see a copy icon in the upper-right hand corner. This will allow you to copy the code. We’ve also included links to additional resources so that you can learn more about key topics. Keep in mind that this guide is a living document. As issues arise, we will update this guide to address them. Additionally, as we think of potential issues, we’ll also update the guide to provide guidance before they occur. We welcome any suggestions for improvements. 0.2 Why Our Approach? There are many different reasons for why we’ve developed this particular approach. The most important of these reasons are 1) we’re a team, 2) drawing upon research, 3) accessibility matters, and 4) a need to avoid the “shiny” problem. We will briefly discuss each one of these in turn. 0.2.1 We’re a Team of Developers From the start, the Book of Apps for Statistics Teaching (BOAST) has been the joint effort of faculty members and students. Having a clear articulation of how to make apps within our environment is critical to ensure that we have cohesiveness between the apps and through the years as the team changes. Our approach is meant to maximize the team’s ability to adapt, maintain, and grow BOAST throughout the years. 0.2.2 Research Driven We place a premium on drawing from what researchers have found about student thinking on various topics. And for those topics where the literature is thin or non-existent, we can fall back on the wealth of experience and expertise our faculty have. When we design apps, we focus on what the learning objectives are and work on how we might support students in developing meanings that are consistent with our targets. 0.2.3 Accesiblity Minded One of the key ways in which our approach differs from a vast majority of others is the level of accessibility thinking we go through. Shiny apps are not very accessible by default and are extremely easy to make even more inaccessible. For example, consider the following entries in the 2020 Shiny app competition, as of 10/15/2020: Blog Explorer by Stefan Schliebs: This Grand Prize winner has 11 accessibility errors, 68 contrast errors, and 14 accessibility alerts. Life of Pi: A Monte Carlo Simulation by Zauad Shahereer Abeer: This Honorable mention has 17 accessibility errors, 13 contrast errors, and 9 accessibility alerts. OTS Beta Dashboard by Mauricio Vargas: This Honorable mention generates 14 accessibility errors, 0 contrast errors, and 5 accessibility alerts. Probability of Normal Distribution by Aep Hidayatuloh: Produces 5 accessibility errors, 108 contrast errors, and 27 accessibility alerts. Didactic Modeling Process: Linear Regression by Daniel Rivera: while not part of the Shiny contest, this is a currently featured app in RStudio’s Shiny User Showcase, which has 57 accessibility errors, 26 contrast errors, and 184 accessibility alerts. We used WebAIM’s Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE) to get these measurements. However, we must point out that the above numbers are under-estimates. The nature of a Shiny app interferes with WAVE’s scanning tool (for example, non-displayed app pages aren’t checked) as well as the fact that rendered R plots can only be checked for the presence of alt text/aria labels but not contrast errors, small font sizes, etc. Now, this isn’t to say that our apps are problem free. However, our process ensures that the number of errors that exist are in the single digits. When we publish an app, most of the remaining errors are ones we inherent from the shiny package and we’re striving to address. 0.2.4 Avoid the “Shiny” Problem In Education, and particularly in the American system, we wrestle with the “silver bullet problem”. This problem is the belief that some reform effort will function as a fix or cure-all for the issues facing the education system. These reforms never bare out. In design, people can get caught up with new (at least to them) tools such as a glitzy new system to do something. They will then start incorporating it everywhere they can. However, they often don’t stop to think about whether this glittery new toy is appropriate or sound design. This is especially true for novice designers. When dealing with Shiny apps for teaching, we face both problems simultaneously, which we call “The Shiny Problem”. We work hard to ensure that Our apps aren’t going to be viewed as silver bullets but as useful resources that can supplement instruction. Just because R can do something doesn’t automatically mean that we’re going to include it; there must be a sound educational and pedagogical reason for including it. Just because there’s a fancy new package that’s been released doesn’t mean we’ll blindly adopt it and use it wherever; there must be a sound educational and pedagogical reason. Just because someone else made an app that did such-and-such doesn’t mean we’re going to; there must be a sound educational and pedagogical reason. If you notice, ensuring that our apps are based in sound educational and pedagogical practices is key to our decision making. We strive for our Shiny apps to not become shiny. We hope that this Welcome has helped you develop an image for the basis for many of the decisions that we’ve laid out in this guide.
